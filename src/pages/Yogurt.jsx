                            <p>I designed and developed a responsive, mobile-first website for <span>a fictional frozen yogurt shop called Yogurt Yoghurt Yoghurt Yogurt√©</span>, inspired by its appearance on the tv series <span>The Good Place</span>. The website needed to showcase various frozen yogurt flavors, provide contact information, and ensure a seamless user experience across mobile, tablet and desktop devices. </p>
                            <p>The project aimed to incorporate web design best practices, such as using wireframes, implementing responsive design with a grid system, and incorporating JavaScript plugins to enhance interactivity.</p>

                            <h4 className="fw-6">Pixel Perfect Design</h4>
                            <p>Ensuring the website was particularly difficult since this was my first time designing wireframes and building a site to match then exactly. I had to focus on details like spacing, alignment, font sizes, and image placement to make sure the website looked the consistent across all devices.</p>

                            <p>To deal with the plugin issues, I spent additional time researching how to modify the settings to align with the desired look and functionality. After experimenting with various configurations, I was able to make the plugins work seamlessly. </p>
                            <p>For the pixel perfect design, I relied heavily on my wireframes in Figma to guide my layout and design decision. I used browser developer tools and chrome extensions to compare the live site with the wireframes and fine-tuned elements until everything aligned well. This process took time, but it allowed me to maintain a high level of precision.</p>
