                        To design a logo that represents my personal brand through a combination of typography and a mascot character. The logo should reflect my identity and work as a web developer, with a clean and modern aesthetic that connects to both vintage mascot influences and current design trends.
                        </p>

                        <img src={LogoRough} alt=""/>
                        <p className=" logo-text pretendard mt-6" >The process began with sketching out ideas for the mascot character. I wanted the character to have a clear connection to me, so I incorporated details like my beanie and headphones, which are part of my go-to style.

                        <p className=" logo-text pretendard mb-6">The character also needed to symbolize my work in web development, so I added a laptop to the design. After finalizing the sketch, I used a tablet to digitize the drawing and then refined it further in Adobe Illustrator. While the character came together fairly easily, the background was a bit trickier. I experimented with several options before deciding on asimple background that wouldnâ€™t detract from the mascot itself.</p>

                        <p className=" logo-text pretendard">The process of creating these variations was simple but fun. After finalizing the main mascot design, I adjusted the hands and positioning in Adobe Illustrator to incorporate the different items. This allowed me to create a set of logos that felt cohesive but could be used in avariety of contexts without losing the core identity of my brand.</p>
