                The goal was to design a logo that represents my personal brand through a combination of typography and a mascot character. The logo should reflect my identity and work as a web developer, with a clean and modern aesthetic that connects to both vintage mascot influences and current design trends.

                <p className=" logo-text pretendard mt-6" >The process began with sketching out ideas. Initially, I explored the idea of using typography, as well as the possibility of creating a mascot character. To refine my vision, I searched logos featuring mascot characters for inspo.

After finalizing the main mascot design, I adjusted the hands and tools in Adobe Illustrator to incorporate different items.
